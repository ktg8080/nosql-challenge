Eat, Safe, Love - UK Food Hygiene Ratings Evaluation

Project Overview

This repository focuses on evaluating food hygiene ratings provided by the UK Food Standards Agency. The project, in collaboration with Eat Safe, Love, helps the magazine’s journalists and food critics identify establishments for future articles by analyzing key hygiene data and trends.

Objective

The aim is to:

	•	Set up a NoSQL database to manage food hygiene ratings.
	•	Modify and clean the dataset according to the magazine’s requirements.
	•	Perform exploratory analysis to answer specific questions posed by the editors of Eat Safe, Love.


 Credits: Classwork was used to create the code. The last block of code in NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb was created with the help of ChatGPT to help verify the coordinates and rating value are numbers.
